# Food Tracker

A simple food tracker. More coming when this is fleshed out.

Planned features:
- Tracking types and amounts of ingredients.
- Tracking recipes.
- Recipes can inform you when you have the ingredients, or tell you what ingredients you're missing.
- "Making" a recipe, which automatically subtracts the ingredients from your local store.
- When ingredients fall below a certain threshold, add them to a Google shopping list. (Possibly
  other providers, too.)
- Pulling recipes from a Pinterest account.
- Maybe adding voice controls to Google Home/Amazon Alexa.
